- [**4 sheets of US sized computer paper**]
- [about 300mL water]
- [1tsp binder]

#### Instructions:
1. [Blend ingredients]
2. [Mold ingredients]
3. [Sculpt]

#### Tips:
[Press the edges of the pulp down where it meets the sides of the mold to reduce the amount of flashing.]

#### Opportunities for experimentation:
[Binders made from invasive species could be a great way to reduce the harm caused by using virgin materials.]

#### Questions for the community:
[I don't have access to a hydraulic press and would love to see if anyone has testing compressing this material on a press like that.]
