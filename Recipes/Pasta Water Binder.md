# Cai Board: Kuzu Binder

### Purpose of Material
Cai Board is a paper-based modeling material that can replace extruded polystyrene foam. 

Many Cai Board recipes use virgin materials. Making it with pasta water means that more of or all of the board can be made with waste or recycled materials. And if you tend to pour your pasta water down the drain, then you can help divert more waste from reaching water treatment facilities.

#### Pros:
Cai Board: cheaper, reduces plastic consumption and the amount of paper and plastic that gets thrown into landfills, you won't be breathing in as many microplastics

Cai Board made from pasta water: compared to other binders, pasta water can produce a harder board. This means that while it will produce less tearout, it will also be much harder to sculpt by hand. If making Cai Board with pasta water, it may be best to sculpt it with power tools.

#### Cons: 
It's heavier than a lot of modeling foams and can't be cut on a hot wire.

#### Sourcing the Waste Material(s): 
This recipe uses waste paper, which is readily and easily available- junk mail is a great source. Just make sure you remove any staples, tape, or plastic-based glues. It also uses leftover pasta water, so how much pasta you make will limit how much board you make. You can save your pasta water in the fridge to build up a store over a couple of days, and you can dilute your water to make it go farter. Recycling the water you squeeze out of your pulp into new batches can also help you increase your Cai Board batch size.

#### Potential Safety Issues: 
Like with all materials that produce dust, such as wood and foam, make sure you always wear a dust mask or resporator when carving your board. Keep in mind that if you use binders like pasta water made from wheat pasta, some people may have allergic reactions to your material.

### Recipe

#### Ingredients, waste materials **bolded**:
- **waste paper**
- +300mL (1-1/4c) pasta water

#### Equipment:
- blender (not to be used for making food)
- measuring spoons &/or a scale
- sponges & towels
- molds
- paper
- binder, such as kuzu
- fan
- safety equipment

#### Time:
- 5-20min to make depending on batch size
- 6hr-days to dry depending on fans, humidity, and temperature
- 15min-hr to sculpt

#### Instructions:
Check back to see the instructions after the Kickstarter Campaign ends! In the meantime, see the Kickstarter campaing here!

#### Tips:
Press the edges of the pulp down where it meets the sides of the mold to reduce the amount of flashing.

#### Opportunities for experimentation:
Experiment with the ideal amount of pasta water to add for the methods with which you will be working with the Cai Board. Smaller amounts of pasta water can still help reduce tearout, just to a lesser degree, while making it easier to work with by hand.

#### Questions for the community:
Have you found if using different types of water made while cooking pasta made with different ingredients produces different results. Ex: red lentil pasta vs wheat pasta
