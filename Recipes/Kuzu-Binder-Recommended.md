# Cai Board: Kuzu Binder

### Purpose of Material
Cai Board is a paper-based modeling material that can replace extruded polystyrene foam.

#### Pros:
Cai Board: cheaper, reduces plastic consumption and the amount of paper and plastic that gets thrown into landfills, you won't be breathing in as many microplastics
Cai Board made form kuzu: compared to other binders, kuzu can produce better results when it comes to minimizing tearout from sawing and sanding. And unlike other binders that are almost as good at making a carvable foam-replacer, it does not stick as much to molds. And since kuzu is plant derived without being so highly processed as to become a semi-synthetic compound, it is fully biodegradable and compostable.

#### Cons: 
It's heavier than a lot of modeling foams and can't be cut on a hot wire.

### Recipe

#### Ingredients, waste materials **bolded**:
- **waste paper**
- kuzu
- +300mL (1-1/4c) water

#### Equipment:
- blender (not to be used for making food)
- measuring spoons &/or a scale
- sponges & towels
- molds
- paper
- binder, such as kuzu
- fan
- safety equipment

#### Time:
- 5-20min to make depending on batch size
- 6hr-days to dry depending on fans, humidity, and temperature
- 15min-hr to sculpt

#### Instructions:
Check back to see the instructions after the Kickstarter Campaign ends! In the meantime, see the Kickstarter campaing here!

#### Tips:
Press the edges of the pulp down where it meets the sides of the mold to reduce the amount of flashing.

#### Opportunities for experimentation:
In the southern US, kudzu is an invasive species; kuzu is the starch made from kudzu. Binders made from invasive species could be a great way to reduce the harm caused by using virgin materials.

Experiment with the ideal amount of kuzu to add for the methods with which you will be working with the foam-replacer. Smaller amounts of kuzu can still help reduce tearout, just to a lesser degree.

#### Questions for the community:
I don't have access to a hydraulic press and would love to see if anyone has testing compressing this material on a press like that. Or if anyone has any leads on kuzu sourced from invasive species.
