# Cai Board: 

### Purpose of Material
a paper-based modeling material that can replace extruded polystyrene

#### Pros:
cheaper, reduces plastic consumption and the amount of paper and plastic that gets thrown into landfills, you won't be breathing in as many microplastics

#### Cons: 
heavier than a lot of modeling foams, can't be cut on a hot wire

### Recipe

#### Ingredients, waste materials **bolded**:
- **27g or 6 sheets of 8.5”x11” waste paper**
- about 300mL water
- +300mL (1-1/4c) water

#### Equipment:
- blender (not to be used for making food)
- measuring spoons &/or a scale
- sponges & towels
- molds
- paper
- binder, such as kuzu
- fan
- safety equipment

#### Time:
- 5-20min to make depending on batch size
- 6hr-days to dry depending on fans, humidity, and temperature
- 15min-hr to sculpt

#### Instructions:
Check back to see the instructions after the Kickstarter Campaign ends! In the meantime, see the Kickstarter campaing here!

#### Tips:
Press the edges of the pulp down where it meets the sides of the mold to reduce the amount of flashing.

#### Opportunities for experimentation:
Binders made from invasive species could be a great way to reduce the harm caused by using virgin materials.

#### Questions for the community:
I don't have access to a hydraulic press and would love to see if anyone has testing compressing this material on a press like that.
