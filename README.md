# Hello! Welcome to the Cai Board fork of the Designing With Waste Repository. 

Here you will learn how to make Cai Board, a paper-based replacement for extruded polystyrene modeling foams like pink, blue, and REN foam. Cai Board is part of the Cai Modeling Materials that were developed by Mari Miller.

Go to the Instructions folder to see sets of instructions for making different versions of Cai Board. Each recipe utilizes a different binder ingredient that will give you different material properties. See a record of tests in the Tests folder. And if you’re having trouble, visit the Troubleshooting document. 

### Why Cai?

We all know that paper is the stuff you write and draw on, but it’s not just a mundane material. The [invention of paper](https://paper.gatech.edu/invention-paper-0) is attributed to Cai Lun in 105 AD. Earlier archaeological examples of paper have been found in China, though little is known about the craft of papermaking prior to Cai Lun. That is why these modeling materials are called Cai Modeling Materials, to not just honor the history of paper but to connect you, a prospective paper maker, to its millennia-long history. To remind us all that if we want the human race to survive for millennia more, we need to embrace regenerative technologies, be they historical or brand new.

### About

Cai Board and the Designing With Waste [website](designingwithwaste.com) and [repository](https://github.com/designingwithwaste/designingwithwaste) were made by Mari Miller, a designer, artist, and maker who wants to make knowledge about materials and making more accessible. See her other work [here](https://marimiller.cargo.site/).
